<h2>Description</h2>
<ul>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>â–¢1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2cups of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>whole milk</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>pepper</li>

</ul>
<ol>
    <P>Steps:</P>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.</li>
   
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.  Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
   
    <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles.  Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
   
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand.  Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often.  Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
    <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.
