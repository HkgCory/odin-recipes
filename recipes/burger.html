<h2>Description</h2>
<ul>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <li>1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of minced onion</li>
    <li>1 piece of tomato</li>

    <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
   
    <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill.
